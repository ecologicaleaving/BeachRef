## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
- **Story 3.1**: Deployment Pipeline Architecture Fix - Foundational deployment infrastructure complete ✅
- **Story 3.2**: Vercel Configuration Optimization - Optimized deployment platform ready ✅
- **Epic 3**: Production deployment focus with reliable deployment infrastructure established

This story builds on the completed deployment infrastructure (Stories 3.1 & 3.2) to add robust error handling and loading states essential for production user experience. With reliable deployment capability now established, this story focuses on production-ready error handling that will be deployed and tested in the live environment.

### Architecture Context
[Source: fullstack-architecture.md#error-handling-strategy]

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- **Client-Side Errors**: React Error Boundaries with fallback UI
- **API Errors**: Categorized error responses with appropriate retry logic
- **Network Errors**: Exponential backoff retry with user feedback
- **Data Errors**: Graceful degradation with cached/fallback data

**Loading State Patterns:**
- **Initial Load**: Skeleton components matching final UI structure
- **Refresh/Retry**: Inline loading indicators preserving current content
- **Progressive Loading**: Staged loading for complex data dependencies

**Error Recovery Approach:**
1. **Automatic Recovery**: Silent retry for transient network issues
2. **User-Initiated Recovery**: Manual retry buttons for persistent failures  
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback data/UI when recovery fails
4. **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for resolving common issues

### Testing Strategy

**Test File Locations:**
- `__tests__/components/ui/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/ui/ErrorMessage.test.tsx` (enhanced)
- `__tests__/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.test.tsx` (enhanced)
- `__tests__/lib/vis-client.test.ts` (enhanced error handling)

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Error boundary catch and fallback rendering
- API retry logic with exponential backoff
- Loading state transitions and user feedback
- Fallback UI rendering when primary data unavailable
- Error recovery mechanism functionality

### Production Considerations

**Error Monitoring:**
- Client-side error tracking for production debugging
- Error rate monitoring and alerting thresholds
- User experience impact analysis

**Performance Impact:**
- Minimize loading state render cycles
- Efficient error boundary implementation
- Optimized retry mechanisms to avoid request flooding
