# Next Steps

## Frontend Architecture Requirements
Create detailed frontend architecture specification covering:
- Flutter widget architecture and state management patterns
- UI component library and design system implementation
- Responsive design approach for web/mobile compatibility
- Accessibility implementation for WCAG AA compliance
- Performance optimization strategies for Flutter Web

## Mobile Deployment Strategy (Future)
- **Primary Target:** iOS/Android native apps (post-MVP)
- **Secondary:** Flutter Web as backup/demo platform  
- **App Stores:** Deploy to both Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- **Distribution:** Can also distribute as APK for Android if needed

**Current Focus:** Web app deployment with mobile-ready architecture for seamless future transition.

## Development Workflow
1. **Setup Development Environment:** Flutter SDK, Supabase CLI, local development database
2. **Implement Core Services:** Authentication, cache management, VIS integration foundation  
3. **Build MVP Features:** Tournament listing, filtering, bookmarking with offline capability
4. **Deploy Web App:** Vercel deployment with mobile-responsive design
5. **Mobile Transition:** Convert to native apps when ready (architecture already supports this)
