# Project Brief: VisConnect

## Executive Summary

**VisConnect** is a clean, professional web application that provides direct access to FIVB beach volleyball tournament data through the VIS (Volleyball Information System) database. This MVP focuses exclusively on data connection and visualization - no authentication, no user management, just a streamlined interface for viewing tournament information.

**Key Details:**
- **Product Concept:** Simple web interface to VIS database with clean data presentation
- **Primary Problem:** Need easy, professional access to FIVB beach volleyball tournament data
- **Target Market:** Beach volleyball community (referees, coaches, analysts)
- **Value Proposition:** Direct, no-friction access to VIS data with professional presentation
- **MVP Scope:** VIS API connection + data visualization only

## Problem Statement

The beach volleyball community lacks easy access to FIVB tournament data from the VIS system. While VIS contains comprehensive tournament information, there's no simple, professional interface to view this data without complex authentication or system navigation.

**Current Challenge:**
- **Limited VIS Access:** VIS data is not easily accessible through a clean web interface
- **No Professional Presentation:** Need for clean, organized data visualization
- **Barrier to Entry:** Current access methods are complex or restricted

**MVP Solution:** Create a straightforward web application that connects to VIS and presents tournament data in a clean, professional format.
