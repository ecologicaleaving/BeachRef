# Project Brief: BeachRef

## Executive Summary

**BeachRef** is a specialized web application designed for beach volleyball referees to access FIVB tournament data through the VIS (Volleyball Information System) database. The platform enables referees to efficiently filter tournaments, view match results, and access referee-specific information, streamlining their workflow and improving access to critical competition data.

**Key Details:**
- **Product Concept:** Web-based referee tool connected to FIVB's VIS database
- **Primary Problem:** Referees currently lack easy access to consolidated tournament and match data
- **Target Market:** Beach volleyball referees working with FIVB tournaments
- **Value Proposition:** Centralized, filtered access to tournament data with referee-focused interface

## Problem Statement

Beach volleyball referees face significant challenges in accessing and organizing tournament information during their professional duties. Currently, referees must navigate multiple systems and sources to gather essential data about tournaments, match schedules, results, and referee assignments, creating inefficiencies that impact their preparation and performance.

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Fragmented Data Access:** Tournament information scattered across different platforms and systems
- **Time-Intensive Research:** Referees spend valuable time searching for basic tournament and match information
- **Limited Referee-Specific Views:** Existing systems don't provide referee-focused data organization
- **Real-Time Updates Challenge:** Difficulty staying current with match results and schedule changes

**Impact:** These inefficiencies reduce referee preparation time, potentially affect match quality, and create unnecessary administrative burden on referees who should focus on officiating excellence.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Current tournament viewing platforms are designed for fans and general audiences, not for the specific workflow needs of referees who require detailed, filterable access to professional tournament data.

**Urgency:** With increasing FIVB tournament activity and professionalization of beach volleyball officiating, referees need modern tools that match their professional responsibilities.
