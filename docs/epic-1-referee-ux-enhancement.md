I want the interface optimized for mobile tournament-day usage,
so that I can efficiently access tournament information from my phone during events.

**Key Components**: Mobile responsive patterns, touch optimization

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture Integration Points
- **Data Layer**: `lib/vis-client.ts` - VIS API integration (preserve)
- **Components**: `components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx` - enhance with shadcn
- **Styling**: Current Tailwind configuration - extend with shadcn theme
- **Build**: Next.js App Router + Vercel deployment - maintain compatibility

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
This epic follows a **gradual enhancement approach**:
1. Start with foundation setup (no UI changes)
2. Replace components incrementally 
3. Maintain existing functionality throughout
4. End with comprehensive mobile optimization

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All existing tournament data display functionality preserved
- âœ… Professional UI matching FIVB aesthetic implemented
- âœ… Mobile experience optimized for referee tournament usage
- âœ… shadcn component system fully integrated
- âœ… Performance maintained or improved
- âœ… Build and deployment pipeline working smoothly
