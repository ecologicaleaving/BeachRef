# Epic 3: Deployment & Production

## Status: Ready for Implementation

## Epic Goal

Ensure robust production deployment with comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, and production-ready monitoring for the BeachRef MVP application.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Built on foundation from Epic 1 & 2 (Next.js + VIS API + UI)
- Tournament display interface complete
- Technology stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Target platform: Vercel with GitHub integration

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added: Production-ready deployment configuration and optimizations
- How it integrates: Enhanced existing application with production concerns
- Success criteria: 
  - 100% successful deployments via GitHub integration
  - Error rate < 1% in production
  - 99%+ uptime (Vercel SLA)
  - Performance targets met consistently

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1:** Deployment Pipeline Architecture Fix
   - Resolve dual-pipeline conflicts between GitHub Actions and Vercel
   - Standardize Node.js version and package management across environments
   - Achieve >95% deployment success rate

2. **Story 3.2:** Vercel Configuration Optimization
   - Optimize Vercel build configuration for Next.js 14 best practices
   - Configure proper environment variable management
   - Implement build caching to reduce deployment time to <2 minutes

3. **Story 3.3:** Production Error Handling & Loading States
   - Implement comprehensive error boundaries
   - Add graceful fallbacks for API failures
   - Create user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms

4. **Story 3.4:** Performance Optimization & Caching
   - Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting
   - Configure proper caching headers for static assets
   - Add performance monitoring and optimization

5. **Story 3.5:** Production Deployment & Monitoring
   - Configure Vercel production environment settings
   - Set up deployment health checks
   - Implement basic monitoring and alerting

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Vercel platform requirements fully met
- [ ] Next.js production optimizations enabled
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all connections
- [ ] Security headers properly configured

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Production deployment failures or performance issues
- **Mitigation:** Staged deployment with health checks and rollback capability
- **Rollback Plan:** Automatic Vercel rollback to previous working deployment

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Application deploys successfully via GitHub push
- [ ] Error handling covers all identified failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance targets consistently met in production
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for critical issues
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS properly configured
- [ ] Load testing confirms application stability
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment procedures

## Technical Context

**Performance Targets (Production):**

- Page Load Speed: < 3s (P95) on 3G
- API Response Time: < 2s (P95)
- Build Time: < 2 minutes
- Deploy Time: < 5 minutes from push to live

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- VIS API failures with cached data fallback
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid/malformed data responses
- Browser compatibility issues

**Security Configuration:**

- HTTPS enforcement
- Proper CORS headers
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Input validation and XSS protection

**Monitoring & Alerting:**

- Deployment success/failure notifications
- API error rate monitoring
- Performance degradation alerts
- Uptime monitoring

**Environment Configuration:**

- Production environment variables
- API rate limiting considerations
- Caching strategy optimization
- CDN configuration for static assets

**Timeline:** Day 4 of the 4-day development schedule
