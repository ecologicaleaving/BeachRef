### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 767px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px  
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

### Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile layout, enhance for larger screens
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Horizontal scroll for data tables
- Collapsible filters and navigation

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large tournament lists
- Skeleton states during data fetching
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features

## 9. Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG AA Compliance
- Color contrast ratios of 4.5:1 minimum
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

### Specific Implementations
- Table headers properly associated with data cells
- Search/filter form labels clearly describe purpose
- Error messages programmatically associated with form fields
- Loading states announced to screen readers

## 10. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### API Connection Failures
- Clear error message: "Unable to connect to tournament data. Please try again."
- Retry button with loading state
- Graceful degradation - show cached data if available

### Empty States
- No tournaments found: Suggest adjusting filters with clear messaging
- Tournament with no matches: Show tournament info with "No matches scheduled"
- Loading states: Skeleton UI for all major components

### Data Quality Issues
- Missing referee assignments: Show "TBD" with appropriate styling
- Incomplete match results: Clear indication of partial data
- Invalid dates/times: Show raw data with warning indicator

## 11. Performance Specifications

### Loading Time Targets
- **Initial page load**: < 3 seconds
- **Tournament list refresh**: < 2 seconds
- **Tournament detail navigation**: < 1.5 seconds

### Implementation Strategies

- Efficient API calls with proper caching headers
- Progressive data loading for tournament details

## 12. Browser Support

### Primary Support
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Mobile Support
- iOS Safari 14+
- Android Chrome 90+

### Graceful Degradation
- Basic functionality in older browsers
- Progressive enhancement for modern features
- No JavaScript fallbacks for critical data access

## 13. Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Framework**: React + Vite with shadcn/ui components
- **Component Mapping**:
  - Data Tables → Data Table + TanStack Table integration
  - Forms → Input + Select + Date Picker + Command
  - Navigation → Breadcrumb + Button components

- **API Integration**: RESTful calls to VIS database

### Development Priorities
1. Core data display (tournament list, details)
2. Search and filtering functionality
3. Responsive design implementation
4. Error handling and loading states
5. Accessibility features and testing

### Testing Strategy
- Component unit tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing on various devices and connections
