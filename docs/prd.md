# VisConnect Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Provide clean, professional web interface for viewing FIVB tournament data from VIS
- Enable direct access to VIS data without authentication barriers
- Deliver MVP functionality: VIS connection + data visualization only
- Create foundation for future feature expansion
- Establish simple, efficient data presentation

### Background Context

The beach volleyball community lacks easy access to FIVB tournament data from the VIS system. While VIS contains comprehensive tournament information, there's no simple, professional interface to view this data without complex authentication or system navigation.

VisConnect addresses this by providing a straightforward web application that connects to VIS and presents tournament data in a clean, professional format. The MVP focuses exclusively on data connection and visualization - no authentication, no user management, just streamlined access to tournament information.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
VisConnect provides a clean, professional interface for viewing FIVB tournament data. The design prioritizes quick data access and clear presentation over complex features, with a focus on information clarity and efficient navigation. The interface uses modern UI components (shadcn/ui) to ensure professional appearance.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct Access:** No login barriers - immediate access to tournament data
- **Clean Data Tables:** Tournament and match information presented in organized, readable tables
- **Simple Filtering:** Basic filtering options for finding relevant tournaments
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptive layouts that work on desktop and mobile devices

### Core Screens and Views (MVP)
- **Tournament List:** Main view showing all available tournaments with basic filtering
- **Tournament Detail:** Single tournament view with matches and basic information
- **Match Results:** Match information including scores and teams

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast ratios.

### Branding
Maintain FIVB's official branding guidelines with clean, professional styling appropriate for sports officiating tools. Use FIVB's color palette and typography standards while ensuring optimal readability for data-heavy interfaces.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary platform is responsive web application supporting desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) with offline capability for essential features.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both frontend and backend code to simplify development and deployment processes for the MVP.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith Architecture:** Single web application with integrated frontend and backend services. This approach simplifies initial development, deployment, and maintenance while providing clear upgrade path to microservices if needed.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for business logic and integration tests for VIS API connectivity. Manual testing for UI/UX validation and cross-browser compatibility.

### Technical Stack (MVP)
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript for component-based UI development
- **UI Framework:** shadcn/ui components for consistent, professional interface
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express for API development and VIS integration
- **Database:** None required for MVP (direct API calls)
- **Authentication:** None for MVP - direct access
- **API Integration:** RESTful integration with FIVB VIS web services
- **Hosting:** Simple cloud deployment
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (included with shadcn/ui)
