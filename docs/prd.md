# BeachRef Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable beach volleyball referees to efficiently access FIVB tournament data through VIS integration
- Provide referee-specific filtering and organization of tournament information
- Streamline referee workflow preparation and match data review
- Deliver MVP functionality for tournament filtering, match results, and referee data viewing
- Establish foundation for expanded referee tools and features

### Background Context

Beach volleyball referees currently face significant challenges accessing consolidated tournament information from FIVB's VIS database. Existing systems are designed for general audiences rather than referee-specific workflows, creating inefficiencies in preparation and match management. BeachRef addresses this gap by providing a purpose-built web application that connects directly to VIS, offering referees the filtered, organized access they need to focus on officiating excellence rather than data hunting.

The MVP focuses on core functionality: tournament filtering, match results viewing, and referee information access. This foundation enables referees to quickly find relevant tournaments and track match data, while establishing the technical infrastructure for future referee-focused features.
