## Requirements

*Incorporating referee journey mapping insights from user workflow analysis*

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The existing tournament table display will be redesigned using shadcn Table components with enhanced sorting, search capabilities, and visual hierarchy to support referee pre-tournament preparation workflow.

**FR2**: Tournament information will be restructured using shadcn Card components to create scannable information containers optimized for mobile referee usage during tournaments.

**FR3**: Tournament status indicators will be implemented using shadcn Badge components to provide immediate visual feedback on tournament states (upcoming, live, completed).

**FR4**: Loading states will be enhanced with shadcn Skeleton components and modern loading patterns to handle VIS API delays professionally during tournament-day stress conditions.

**FR5**: Error handling UI will be upgraded to use shadcn Alert and Toast components for better user feedback, particularly for connectivity issues referees face in tournament venues.

**FR6**: Navigation system will implement shadcn Sheet/Dialog components for detailed tournament information overlays without losing main view context.

**FR7**: The application will implement shadcn's theming system to support high-contrast, outdoor-readable design following FIVB's professional aesthetic.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing VIS API performance characteristics while providing smooth loading transitions for referee workflow continuity.

**NFR2**: Mobile-first responsive design must prioritize touch-friendly interface elements with minimum 44px touch targets for tournament-day usage.

**NFR3**: UI components must maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) with high contrast ratios suitable for various tournament lighting conditions.

**NFR4**: Component implementation must support offline-ready patterns for referee usage in venues with poor connectivity.

**NFR5**: Bundle size optimization must ensure fast loading on mobile networks common in tournament venues.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing VIS API integration and data parsing in `lib/vis-client.ts` must remain unchanged and compatible with new component implementations.

**CR2**: Current Tailwind CSS configuration must coexist with shadcn's styling system, maintaining existing responsive breakpoints.

**CR3**: All existing tournament data fields must be preserved and enhanced in new shadcn component implementations without data loss.

**CR4**: Vercel deployment pipeline must remain compatible with shadcn dependencies and build optimization requirements.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
New shadcn components will replace current basic HTML/Tailwind elements while maintaining the existing Next.js App Router structure. The component integration will follow shadcn's composition patterns, allowing the current `components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx` to be enhanced rather than completely rewritten, preserving existing data flow and error handling logic.
