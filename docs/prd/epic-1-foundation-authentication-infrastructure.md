# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the technical foundation for BeachRef including project setup, VIS API connectivity, and referee authentication integration. This epic delivers a secure, deployable application with basic health monitoring and the ability to authenticate FIVB referees.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment
As a developer,
I want a properly configured development environment with build tools and deployment pipeline,
so that I can develop and deploy BeachRef efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Flutter Web project structure created with proper lib/ organization for frontend development
2. pubspec.yaml configuration with all required Flutter dependencies for development and production
3. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore and README documentation
4. Flutter development scripts configured for web development, testing, and building
5. Basic CI/CD pipeline setup for automated testing and deployment
6. Environment configuration management for development, staging, and production

## Story 1.2: VIS API Connection & Health Check
As a system administrator,
I want the application to establish and monitor connectivity to FIVB's VIS database,
so that I can ensure reliable access to tournament data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. VIS API client library configured with proper authentication credentials
2. Health check endpoint that verifies VIS connectivity status
3. Error handling for VIS API connection failures with appropriate logging
4. API rate limiting and retry logic implemented
5. Basic VIS data retrieval test (e.g., tournament count) working successfully
6. Monitoring dashboard showing VIS connection status and response times

## Story 1.3: Referee Authentication System
As a beach volleyball referee,
I want to log in using my FIVB credentials,
so that I can access referee-specific tournament information securely.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Login page with FIVB credential input fields and branding
2. Integration with FIVB's authentication system (OAuth2/SAML)
3. Session management with secure token storage and automatic refresh
4. User profile data retrieval from FIVB system including referee information
5. Role-based access control distinguishing referees from other users
6. Secure logout functionality that clears all session data
7. "Remember me" functionality for convenient re-authentication
