# Epic 3: Tournament Detail Page Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable referees to access detailed tournament information through clickable tournament entries, providing comprehensive tournament data, schedule, and results in a professional interface that maintains the existing table/list navigation pattern.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Tournament table displays basic tournament info (name, dates, location, gender, type) in paginated format
- Technology stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, shadcn/ui component system, FIVB VIS API integration
- Integration points: Existing tournament table, VIS API client, shadcn components from Epic 1 & 2

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added/changed**: 
  - Tournament detail page accessible via dynamic route `/tournament/[code]`
  - Enhanced tournament data fetching from VIS API for individual tournaments
  - Professional tournament detail layout using shadcn components
  - Navigation integration between tournament list and detail views
  - Tournament schedule, results, and participant information display

- **How it integrates**: 
  - Extends existing VIS API client to fetch detailed tournament data
  - Uses Next.js App Router dynamic routing with tournament code parameter
  - Builds upon existing shadcn component system from Epic 1
  - Maintains existing pagination and table functionality from Epic 2

- **Success criteria**: 
  - Referees can click any tournament to view detailed information
  - Tournament detail page loads efficiently with professional layout
  - Navigation between list and detail views is seamless
  - All tournament data is accessible and properly formatted

## Stories

### Story 3.1: Tournament Detail Page Foundation and Routing
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Epic 1 (shadcn components), Epic 2 (tournament table)

As a referee,
I want to click on any tournament in the list to view detailed information,
so that I can access comprehensive tournament data for preparation and reference.

**Key Components**: Dynamic routing, VIS API extension, basic detail page layout

### Story 3.2: Tournament Detail Data Display Enhancement
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1

As a referee,
I want to see comprehensive tournament information including schedule and results,
so that I can have all necessary tournament details in one professional interface.

**Key Components**: Tournament data display, schedule sections, results integration

### Story 3.3: Tournament List Navigation Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: Story 3.1, Story 3.2

As a referee,
I want seamless navigation between the tournament list and detail views,
so that I can efficiently browse tournaments and access detailed information.

**Key Components**: Navigation integration, breadcrumbs, mobile-responsive patterns

## Compatibility Requirements

- âœ… Existing tournament table and pagination APIs remain unchanged
- âœ… VIS API integration patterns follow existing lib/vis-client.ts structure  
- âœ… UI components follow existing shadcn theme and responsive patterns
- âœ… Performance impact is minimal with efficient data fetching

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: VIS API performance impact from additional detailed tournament data requests
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching strategy and progressive data loading
- **Rollback Plan**: Tournament detail routes can be disabled via feature flag, reverting to existing table-only functionality

## Definition of Done

- âœ… All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- âœ… Existing tournament table functionality verified through testing
- âœ… Tournament detail pages integrate properly with existing navigation
- âœ… Documentation updated for new routing and API patterns
- âœ… No regression in existing tournament list and pagination features

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture Integration Points
- **Data Layer**: `lib/vis-client.ts` - Extends VIS API integration for detailed tournament data
- **Components**: Builds upon existing shadcn components from Epic 1
- **Routing**: Uses Next.js App Router dynamic routing `/tournament/[code]`
- **Navigation**: Integrates with existing tournament table from Epic 2

### Implementation Strategy
This epic follows an **additive enhancement approach**:
1. Add tournament detail routing without affecting existing pages
2. Extend VIS API client for detailed tournament data
3. Create detail page components using established shadcn patterns
4. Integrate navigation between list and detail views

### Success Criteria
- âœ… Tournament detail pages accessible via clean URLs
- âœ… Professional UI consistent with existing shadcn implementation
- âœ… Efficient data loading with appropriate caching
- âœ… Mobile-responsive detail view optimized for referee usage
- âœ… Seamless navigation maintaining existing functionality
- âœ… Build and deployment pipeline compatibility maintained
