**Implementation Notes**: Final integration story that brings together all Epic 4 components into cohesive tournament detail experience.

**UX Component Requirements**:
- **Enhanced Tab Navigation**: Extended tournament detail tabs with Schedule and Results
- **Progressive Loading**: Load tab content only when activated for performance
- **Consistent Design**: Maintain Epic 3 design patterns across all new tabs
- **Deep Linking**: URL parameter support for direct tab access

## Compatibility Requirements

- âœ… All existing Epic 3 tournament detail functionality remains unchanged
- âœ… VIS API integration follows established error handling patterns from Epic 3
- âœ… UI components follow existing shadcn theme and responsive patterns  
- âœ… Performance impact is minimal with efficient caching and progressive loading
- âœ… Mobile-first design maintains 48px touch targets for venue glove usage

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: VIS API performance impact from additional match data requests
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching strategy (2-minute TTL for schedule, 10-minute for results) and progressive data loading
- **Secondary Risk**: Large tournament schedule data impacting mobile performance
- **Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling for large match lists and optimized data structures
- **Rollback Plan**: Epic 4 features can be disabled via feature flag, reverting to Epic 3 tournament detail functionality

## Definition of Done

- âœ… All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- âœ… Existing tournament detail functionality verified through testing
- âœ… Match schedule and results integrate properly with existing navigation
- âœ… API integration follows Epic 3 error handling and caching patterns
- âœ… Mobile responsive design maintains venue usage requirements
- âœ… Performance meets < 3s loading targets for all Epic 4 features

## UX Design Specifications

### Required shadcn Component Usage

**New Components for Epic 4:**
```bash
# Components already available from Epic 3
âœ… tabs, breadcrumb, accordion, dialog, sheet, avatar, progress, card, badge, button
âœ… skeleton, toast (from Epic 1)

# No new component installations required - Epic 4 uses existing Epic 3 components
```

**Component Usage Patterns**:
- âœ… **Accordion**: Day-by-day match schedule organization
- âœ… **Dialog**: Individual match detail displays  
- âœ… **Card**: Match information cards and team profiles
- âœ… **Badge**: Match status indicators and tournament progress
- âœ… **Progress**: Tournament completion percentage
- âœ… **Avatar**: Team and player representation (if photos available)

### Mobile-First Design Requirements

**Touch Target Standards**:
- âœ… 48px minimum touch targets for all interactive elements
- âœ… Tournament venue glove usage compatibility
- âœ… Single-handed mobile navigation patterns

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
- âœ… Mobile: Schedule displayed in single column with collapsible days
- âœ… Tablet: Two-column layout for match cards within days  
- âœ… Desktop: Multi-column layout with expanded match information

**Performance Requirements**:
- âœ… Initial tournament detail load: < 3s
- âœ… Schedule tab activation: < 2s  
- âœ… Individual match detail dialog: < 1s
- âœ… Results tab activation: < 2s

## API Architecture Integration

### VIS API Endpoints (from APIArchitecture.md)

**Primary Endpoints for Epic 4**:
1. **GetBeachMatchList** - Tournament match schedules and results
2. **GetBeachMatch** - Individual match details with set scores  
3. **GetBeachTournamentRanking** - Final tournament standings

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Following Epic 3 established patterns
export async function fetchTournamentMatches(tournamentNumber: string): Promise<BeachMatch[]>
export async function fetchMatchDetail(matchNumber: string): Promise<BeachMatchDetail>  
export async function fetchTournamentRanking(tournamentNumber: string): Promise<TournamentRanking[]>
```

**Error Handling**: Extends Epic 3's comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms for match data

**Caching Strategy**:
- Schedule data: 2-minute TTL (frequent updates during live tournaments)
- Results data: 10-minute TTL (more stable after completion)
- Match details: 5-minute TTL (balance between freshness and performance)

## Epic 4 Course Correction Integration

### Epic Structure Alignment
- âœ… **Epic 3**: Tournament detail foundation, navigation, error handling - COMPLETED
- ðŸ”„ **Epic 4**: Match schedule, results, and comprehensive tournament data - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
- ðŸ“‹ **Future Epics**: Additional tournament features, advanced analytics, offline capabilities

### Story Sequencing Logic
1. **Story 4.1**: Build UI components first (match schedule display foundation)
2. **Story 4.2**: Add interactive features (match detail dialogs)  
3. **Story 4.3**: Integrate real API data (schedule API integration)
4. **Story 4.4**: Extend functionality (results and rankings)
5. **Story 4.5**: Complete integration (enhanced tabs and navigation)

This sequence ensures UI foundation before API complexity, following Epic 3's successful implementation pattern.
