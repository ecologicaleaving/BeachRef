# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single epic with sequential stories designed to minimize risk to existing system while building cohesive UX enhancement.

**Rationale**: This enhancement should be structured as a single comprehensive epic because:
1. **Cohesive UX Transformation**: All shadcn component implementations need to work together for consistent user experience
2. **Shared Dependencies**: shadcn installation and theming affects all components simultaneously  
3. **Referee Workflow Focus**: The journey mapping shows interconnected touchpoints that benefit from coordinated implementation
4. **Technical Integration**: Component library migration works best as unified effort to avoid style conflicts
