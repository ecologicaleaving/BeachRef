# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Provide clean, professional web interface for viewing FIVB tournament data from VIS
- Enable direct access to VIS data without authentication barriers
- Deliver MVP functionality: VIS connection + data visualization only
- Create foundation for future feature expansion
- Establish simple, efficient data presentation

## Background Context

The beach volleyball community lacks easy access to FIVB tournament data from the VIS system. While VIS contains comprehensive tournament information, there's no simple, professional interface to view this data without complex authentication or system navigation.

VisConnect addresses this by providing a straightforward web application that connects to VIS and presents tournament data in a clean, professional format. The MVP focuses exclusively on data connection and visualization - no authentication, no user management, just streamlined access to tournament information.
