# Requirements

*Incorporating referee journey mapping insights from user workflow analysis*

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The existing tournament table display will be redesigned using shadcn Table components with enhanced sorting, search capabilities, and visual hierarchy to support referee pre-tournament preparation workflow.

**FR2**: Tournament information will be restructured using shadcn Card components to create scannable information containers optimized for mobile referee usage during tournaments.

**FR3**: Tournament status indicators will be implemented using shadcn Badge components to provide immediate visual feedback on tournament states (upcoming, live, completed).

**FR4**: Loading states will be enhanced with shadcn Skeleton components and modern loading patterns to handle VIS API delays professionally during tournament-day stress conditions.

**FR5**: Error handling UI will be upgraded to use shadcn Alert and Toast components for better user feedback, particularly for connectivity issues referees face in tournament venues.

**FR6**: Navigation system will implement shadcn Sheet components for tournament detail overlays with tabbed content (Info, Schedule, Referees, Live) without losing main view context.

**FR7**: The application will implement shadcn's theming system with FIVB color palette (primary #0066CC, accent #FF6B35) to support high-contrast, outdoor-readable design.

**FR8**: Tournament dashboard will provide dual view toggle (Table/Card) with Table as desktop primary and Card as mobile primary view.

**FR9**: Search functionality will implement real-time filtering using shadcn Input component with instant results display.

**FR10**: All interactive elements will meet 44px minimum touch targets optimized for referee gloves during tournament operations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Page performance must achieve First Contentful Paint under 2 seconds on 3G networks with UI interaction response within 100ms.

**NFR2**: All animations must maintain consistent 60fps performance and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting.

**NFR3**: UI components must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with enhanced 4.5:1 color contrast for outdoor tournament visibility.

**NFR4**: Mobile-first responsive design must adapt seamlessly across breakpoints (320px-1440px+) with appropriate layout strategies per device type.

**NFR5**: Component implementation must support offline-ready patterns with cached data fallback and clear connectivity status indicators.

**NFR6**: Bundle size optimization must leverage shadcn tree-shaking and ensure fast loading on mobile networks common in tournament venues.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing VIS API integration and data parsing in `lib/vis-client.ts` must remain unchanged and compatible with new component implementations.

**CR2**: Current Tailwind CSS configuration must coexist with shadcn's styling system, maintaining existing responsive breakpoints.

**CR3**: All existing tournament data fields must be preserved and enhanced in new shadcn component implementations without data loss.

**CR4**: Vercel deployment pipeline must remain compatible with shadcn dependencies and build optimization requirements.
