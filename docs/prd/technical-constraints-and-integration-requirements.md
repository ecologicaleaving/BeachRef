# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack
From document-project analysis:

**Languages**: TypeScript ^5.0.0, JavaScript (Next.js)
**Frameworks**: Next.js ^14.0.0 (App Router), React ^18.2.0
**Database**: None (API-based via FIVB VIS)
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment platform
**External Dependencies**: FIVB VIS API (XML-based), Tailwind CSS ^3.4.0

## Integration Approach

**Component Integration Strategy**: 
- Install shadcn/ui via CLI to maintain proper configuration
- Gradually replace existing components starting with Table and Card
- Preserve existing data fetching patterns in `lib/vis-client.ts`
- Maintain current error handling architecture with enhanced UI feedback

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- Implement shadcn components within existing Next.js App Router structure
- Use shadcn's theming system alongside current Tailwind configuration
- Maintain existing responsive breakpoints while enhancing mobile experience
- Preserve current SSR patterns with shadcn's server-compatible components

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Extend existing Jest test suites to cover new shadcn component implementations
- Maintain current React Testing Library patterns for component testing
- Add visual regression testing considerations for new component library

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- Add `components/ui/` directory for shadcn components via CLI
- Enhance existing `components/tournament/` with shadcn integrations
- Maintain current lib/ structure for business logic separation
- Preserve existing hooks/ directory for custom React hooks

**Naming Conventions**: 
- Follow shadcn's component naming (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- Maintain existing TypeScript interface naming conventions
- Preserve current utility function naming in lib/ directory

**Coding Standards**:
- Integrate shadcn's ESLint rules with existing Next.js configuration
- Maintain current TypeScript strict mode settings
- Follow shadcn's composition patterns for component architecture

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- Ensure shadcn dependencies are properly included in package.json
- Maintain existing Next.js build optimization with new component bundle
- Preserve current Vercel deployment configuration

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- Continue using existing Vercel auto-deployment from master branch
- Test shadcn build compatibility in staging environment
- Maintain current environment variable handling

**Configuration Management**:
- Integrate shadcn theme configuration with existing tailwind.config.js
- Preserve current Next.js configuration while adding shadcn requirements
- Maintain existing TypeScript configuration with shadcn type definitions

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Bundle size increase from shadcn components - *Mitigation: Use tree-shaking and selective imports*
- Styling conflicts between Tailwind and shadcn - *Mitigation: Follow shadcn's Tailwind integration guide*
- Component compatibility with Next.js App Router SSR - *Mitigation: Use shadcn's server-compatible components*

**Integration Risks**:
- Breaking existing VIS API data flow - *Mitigation: Preserve existing data layer, only modify presentation*
- Mobile performance degradation - *Mitigation: Implement progressive enhancement and performance monitoring*

**Deployment Risks**:
- Vercel build failures with new dependencies - *Mitigation: Test build process in development environment first*
- CSS conflicts in production - *Mitigation: Implement CSS purging and conflict detection*

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement gradual rollout starting with least critical components
- Maintain rollback capability by preserving existing component files during migration
- Set up component storybook for isolated testing before integration
