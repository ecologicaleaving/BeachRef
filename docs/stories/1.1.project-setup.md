```

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **Development**: Local Flutter + Supabase local development
- **Staging**: Vercel preview deployments + Supabase staging project
- **Production**: Vercel production + Supabase production project
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions + Vercel integration
- **Pipeline Configuration**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Languages & Runtimes**: Dart 3.2.0+, Flutter 3.16.0+
- **Style & Linting**: flutter_lints 3.0.0+ with custom rules
- **Test Organization**: `test/` mirrors `lib/` structure, `_test.dart` suffix
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Never use print() in production - Use logger service for all output
  - All API responses must use Result<T, Error> - Consistent error handling pattern
  - Database operations must use repository pattern - Never direct Supabase calls from UI
  - Background tasks must respect rate limits - All VIS calls through coordinated sync service
  - Sensitive data must never be logged - Strip PII and tokens from all log output

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: test 1.24.0+ with mockito 5.4.0+ for mocking
- **File Convention**: `test/path/to/file_test.dart` mirrors `lib/path/to/file.dart`
- **Location**: `test/` directory with same structure as `lib/`
- **Mocking Library**: mockito for service mocking, fake objects for simple data
- **Coverage Requirement**: 90%+ for service and business logic classes
- **AI Agent Requirements**:
  - Generate tests for all public methods in services and use cases
  - Cover edge cases and error conditions with proper mocking
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) consistently
  - Mock all external dependencies (Supabase, VIS API, local storage)
- **Test Data Management**: Factory pattern with realistic test data, JSON fixtures in `test/fixtures/` directory
- **CI Integration**: Run unit/integration tests on every PR, E2E on staging deployment
