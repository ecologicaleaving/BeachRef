## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs - this is the first story in the epic.

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/OLD/fullstack-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- Current project uses Next.js 14+ with App Router and React Server Components
- Existing component structure in `components/` directory with UI components in subdirectories
- TypeScript 5.0+ configured for type safety
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ already configured for utility-first styling

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Component Library / Design System]
- shadcn/ui chosen as foundation component library with custom tournament-specific components
- FIVB-inspired color palette: Primary #0066CC (FIVB blue), Secondary #FF6B35 (beach volleyball orange)
- Component mapping strategy includes Table, Card, Badge, Sheet, Toast, Tabs, Skeleton, Alert, Button, Input

[Source: docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md#Integration Approach]
- Install shadcn/ui via CLI to maintain proper configuration
- Preserve existing data fetching patterns in `lib/vis-client.ts`
- Maintain current error handling architecture with enhanced UI feedback
- Use shadcn's theming system alongside current Tailwind configuration

### File Locations
Based on project structure analysis:
- shadcn components will be installed in `components/ui/` directory (created by CLI)
- Main configuration in `components.json` (created by CLI)
- Theme configuration in `app/globals.css` (existing file to be enhanced)
- Tailwind config updates in `tailwind.config.js` (existing file)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: package.json analysis]
- Node.js >=20.0.0, npm >=10.0.0 already configured
- Next.js ^14.0.0, React ^18.2.0, TypeScript ^5.0.0 compatible with shadcn
- Tailwind CSS ^3.4.0 already installed and compatible
- Jest testing framework configured and must continue working

### Testing Requirements
[Source: package.json#scripts]
- Existing test commands: `npm run test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`
- CI pipeline includes: lint, type-check, test, build - all must pass
- Test files use Jest + React Testing Library (@testing-library/react ^16.3.0)
- Ensure shadcn components don't break existing test setup

## Testing
### Test File Location
- Create test file at `__tests__/components/ui/shadcn-integration.test.tsx`
- Follow existing Jest + React Testing Library patterns

### Test Standards
- Unit tests for basic shadcn component rendering
- Integration tests to verify theming works correctly
- Build test to ensure no breaking changes to Next.js compilation
- TypeScript compilation test to verify type definitions

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Test shadcn component imports work without errors
- Verify FIVB color palette loads correctly in theme
- Ensure existing components still render properly after shadcn installation
- Validate that CI pipeline (lint, type-check, test, build) continues to pass
