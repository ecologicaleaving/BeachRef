## Story
**As a** referee,
**I want** professional loading indicators when tournament data is fetching,
**so that** I have clear feedback during VIS API delays in tournament venues.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[From Story 1.1: shadcn Foundation Setup - Status: Approved]
- shadcn/ui CLI is installed and configured with FIVB-inspired theme
- Components.json configured with proper paths and settings
- FIVB color palette integrated: Primary #0066CC, Secondary #FF6B35
- Development environment validates shadcn component imports work correctly
- Foundation is ready for implementing enhanced UI components

### Current Loading Implementation Analysis
[Source: components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]
Current implementation includes comprehensive loading components:
- `LoadingSpinner` (lines 10-56) - Simple spinning indicator with variants (default, retry, inline)
- `LoadingSkeleton` (lines 63-79) - Basic skeleton with configurable rows, animate-pulse animation
- `TableLoadingSkeleton` (lines 87-124) - Sophisticated table skeleton with responsive grid (3/6 columns)
- `ProgressiveLoading` (lines 135-180) - Multi-step loading indicator with completion states

[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx#lines:386-396 - Verified 2025-07-30]
Current loading state usage in TournamentTable component:
```typescript
if (loading) {
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      <TableLoadingSkeleton
        columns={6}
        rows={8}
        className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Loading state managed via React useState: `const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(initialData === null)`
- Activated during VIS API calls in `fetchTournaments()` method (lines 222-252)

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/OLD/fullstack-architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]
- React Server Components with Next.js 14 App Router architecture
- Component-based structure with separation between UI and business logic
- Responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
- Performance optimization focus with sub-3-second load times

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#Component Library / Design System]
- shadcn/ui skeleton components should replace existing loading implementations
- Loading states must support mobile touch-optimized interaction patterns
- Skeleton patterns should match actual content layout for seamless transitions
- Progressive enhancement for various connectivity conditions in tournament venues

### File Locations and Technical Implementation
Based on existing architecture:
- Update `components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx` to integrate shadcn Skeleton primitives
- Modify `components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx` loading state rendering (lines 386-396)
- Create new skeleton components that match existing `TournamentRow.tsx` layout patterns
- Update existing test file `__tests__/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.test.tsx` for new functionality

### VIS API Integration Patterns
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx#fetchTournaments method (lines 222-252) - Verified 2025-07-30]
Current API loading flow:
```typescript
const fetchTournaments = useCallback(async () => {
  setLoading(true);  // Step 1: Enable loading state
  setError(null);
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/tournaments', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
      }
    });
    // Step 2: VIS API call processing
    const data: Tournament[] = await response.json();
    setTournaments(data);  // Step 5: Update tournament data
  } catch (err) {
    setError(errorMessage);  // Step 3: Error handling with setError()
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);  // Step 4: Disable loading state
  }
}, []);
```

### Integration Guidance for Existing Loading Patterns
**Critical Integration Requirements:**
1. **Preserve Loading State Logic** - The existing `loading` boolean state and `setLoading()` calls must remain unchanged
2. **Maintain Error State Coordination** - Loading states must work with existing `error` state and `TournamentError` component
3. **Responsive Loading Preservation** - New skeleton components must respect existing `screenSize` logic (mobile/tablet/desktop)
4. **Performance Characteristics** - New shadcn skeletons must not degrade performance vs current `TableLoadingSkeleton`

**Migration Strategy:**
- Replace skeleton rendering logic while preserving all state management
- Maintain existing prop interfaces: `columns`, `rows`, `className`
- Ensure new components work with existing CSS classes and animations
- Test loading state transitions maintain current timing and behavior

### Responsive Design Requirements
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx#screenSize logic (lines 28-49, 459-573) - Verified 2025-07-30]
Current responsive implementation:
- **Mobile** (screenSize === 'mobile'): Card layout with single column, shows tournaments in mobile card format
- **Tablet** (screenSize === 'tablet'): Modified table with reduced columns, table layout preserved  
- **Desktop** (screenSize === 'desktop'): Full table with all columns visible

[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx#lines:459-573 - Verified 2025-07-30]
Responsive rendering logic:
```typescript
{screenSize === 'desktop' || screenSize === 'tablet' ? (
  /* Table Layout for Desktop and Tablet */
  <div className="overflow-x-auto">
    <table className="w-full min-w-max">
      // Table implementation
    </table>
  </div>
) : (
  /* Mobile Card Layout */
  <div role="table">
    // Card-based implementation
  </div>
)}
```

**Skeleton Integration Requirements:**
- Skeleton components must match these exact responsive patterns
- Mobile skeletons must mirror card layout structure
- Table skeletons must respect tablet/desktop column visibility
- Responsive breakpoints must be preserved: mobile (<768px), tablet (768-1023px), desktop (â‰¥1024px)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: __tests__/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.test.tsx (174 lines) - Verified 2025-07-30]
Existing test patterns to maintain:
- Component rendering tests with proper accessibility attributes (`role="status"`, `aria-label`)
- Custom props and className application testing
- Animation classes verification (`animate-pulse`, responsive grid classes)
- Screen reader support validation (`sr-only` text, `aria-hidden` attributes)

[Source: package.json#scripts - Verified 2025-07-30]
Current test infrastructure:
- Jest framework with React Testing Library
- Test commands: `npm run test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`
- CI pipeline: `npm run ci` includes lint, type-check, test, build steps

**Integration Testing Requirements:**
- shadcn Skeleton component integration testing
- Loading state transition testing with actual API calls
- Responsive skeleton behavior across viewport sizes
- Performance regression testing vs existing `TableLoadingSkeleton`

## Testing
### Test File Location
- Update existing test file: `__tests__/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.test.tsx`
- Create new test file: `__tests__/components/ui/TournamentSkeleton.test.tsx`
- Update integration tests in: `__tests__/components/tournament/TournamentTable.test.tsx`

### Test Standards
- Maintain existing Jest + React Testing Library patterns
- Test shadcn Skeleton component rendering and accessibility
- Verify loading state transitions work correctly
- Test responsive skeleton behavior across screen sizes

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Verify shadcn Skeleton components replace existing loading components successfully
- Test loading state integration with VIS API calls maintains existing functionality
- Validate mobile skeleton patterns perform well on touch devices
- Ensure smooth transitions don't cause layout shifts or performance issues
- Confirm existing CI pipeline (lint, type-check, test, build) continues to pass
