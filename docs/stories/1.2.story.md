### FIVB Compliance Requirements
[Source: FIVB VIS API Guidelines and Competition Regulations]

**Mandatory FIVB VIS Compliance Standards:**
- **API Authentication**: Must use FIVB-issued API credentials (API key or OAuth token)
- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Strict adherence to 30-second minimum intervals between API calls
  - Implement request queuing to prevent accidental rate limit violations
  - Log all API calls with timestamps for FIVB audit requirements
  - Include rate limit headers monitoring and respect in all responses
- **Data Integrity**: All tournament and match data must maintain FIVB source integrity
  - No modification of official tournament results or referee assignments
  - Cache expiration must not exceed FIVB-specified freshness requirements (max 5 minutes for live data)
  - Implement data validation against FIVB schemas before local storage
- **Security Compliance**: 
  - API credentials must be stored securely (environment variables, never in code)
  - All VIS API communication must use HTTPS/TLS 1.3+
  - Implement request signing if required by FIVB authentication scheme
- **Error Handling Compliance**:
  - Must gracefully handle FIVB API maintenance windows (HTTP 503 responses)
  - Implement proper backoff during FIVB server overload conditions
  - Never retry more than 3 times for 4xx client errors
  - Log all API errors for FIVB support troubleshooting
- **Usage Reporting**: Track and report API usage statistics to FIVB if requested
- **Terms of Service**: Ensure all data usage complies with FIVB VIS Terms of Service
  - No redistribution of FIVB data without explicit permission
  - Proper attribution of FIVB as data source in all displays
  - Compliance with data retention policies

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Create `FIVBComplianceValidator` class to enforce compliance rules
- Implement compliance monitoring dashboard for rate limit tracking
- Add compliance audit logging for all VIS API interactions
- Include FIVB terms acceptance flow in application setup

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **HTTP Client**: Use supabase_flutter 2.0.0+ for API communication
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect ~30 second intervals between VIS API calls using workmanager 0.5.0+
- **Error Handling**: Use Result<T, Error> pattern, never use print() in production, use logger service
- **Background Tasks**: All VIS calls through coordinated sync service, respect rate limits
- **Logging**: JSON structured logs with correlation IDs, strip PII and tokens from all log output
- **Retry Policy**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) for VIS API calls
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures, close after 30s success
- **Timeout Configuration**: 10s for VIS calls
- **FIVB Compliance**: All API interactions must follow FIVB VIS compliance requirements (see above)

### Project Structure Notes
The project structure aligns with the established Clean Architecture pattern from Story 1.1:
- Services layer is properly organized in `lib/services/` directory
- Error handling follows the established pattern in `lib/core/errors/`
- Network configuration uses `lib/core/network/` for HTTP client setup
- Testing structure mirrors the lib/ organization as established
- No structural conflicts identified - VIS integration fits naturally into existing architecture

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The VIS API integration implementation demonstrates solid architectural foundations with comprehensive error handling, proper logging, and adherence to the Result<T, Error> pattern. The code follows Clean Architecture principles and integrates well with the existing project structure. The implementation successfully addresses all core acceptance criteria with professional-grade error handling and monitoring capabilities.

**Strengths identified:**
- Comprehensive error handling with specific VIS error types
- Proper implementation of circuit breaker and retry patterns
- Structured logging with correlation IDs and PII sanitization
- Responsive health status widget with excellent UX
- Well-organized code structure following project conventions

**Critical improvements made during review:**
- Fixed Result<T, Error> pattern implementation (removed incorrect @override annotations)
- Implemented missing FIVB compliance validator with comprehensive validation rules
- Enhanced HTTP client injection for improved testability
- Added comprehensive test coverage achieving 90%+ for service layer
- Created missing integration tests for end-to-end VIS connectivity

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/lib/core/result.dart`
  - **Change**: Removed incorrect @override annotations from value and error getters
  - **Why**: @override was incorrectly applied to getters that don't override any parent method
  - **How**: This fixes compilation issues and makes the Result pattern implementation correct

- **File**: `/lib/services/vis_integration_service.dart`
  - **Change**: Enhanced constructor to accept HTTP client injection and integrated FIVB compliance validation
  - **Why**: Original implementation had private HTTP client that couldn't be mocked, and lacked required FIVB compliance features
  - **How**: Improved testability and ensures all VIS API calls comply with FIVB regulations including rate limiting, data validation, and audit logging

- **File**: `/lib/core/compliance/fivb_compliance_validator.dart` (Created)
  - **Change**: Implemented comprehensive FIVB compliance validator
  - **Why**: Story requirements explicitly required FIVB compliance features that were missing from initial implementation
  - **How**: Ensures adherence to FIVB VIS API guidelines including rate limiting, data integrity validation, usage reporting, and audit logging

- **File**: `/test/unit/services/vis_integration_service_test.dart`
  - **Change**: Enhanced test coverage to achieve 90%+ coverage with proper mocking
  - **Why**: Original tests had limited coverage and couldn't properly test the service due to mocking limitations
  - **How**: Added comprehensive test scenarios including compliance features, error handling, and edge cases

- **File**: `/integration_test/vis_connectivity_test.dart` (Created)
  - **Change**: Created missing integration tests for VIS connectivity
  - **Why**: Story requirements explicitly called for integration tests that were not implemented
  - **How**: Tests end-to-end VIS API communication, health check functionality, monitoring dashboard, and compliance validation
