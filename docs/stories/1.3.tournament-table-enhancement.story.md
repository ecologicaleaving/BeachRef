### Current Tournament Table Implementation Analysis
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx (586 lines) - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Core Architecture:**
- React functional component with comprehensive state management
- Responsive design with breakpoint detection: mobile (<768px), tablet (768-1023px), desktop (â‰¥1024px)
- Advanced sorting functionality with visual indicators and ARIA support
- Touch gesture support for horizontal scrolling with momentum scrolling
- Sophisticated accessibility implementation with screen reader support

**Current Table Structure (lines 474-547):**
```typescript
<table
  className="w-full min-w-max"
  role="table"
  aria-label={`Beach volleyball tournaments for 2025. ${sortedTournaments.length} tournaments found.`}
>
  <thead className="bg-gray-50 border-b border-gray-200">
    <tr role="row">
      {/* Dynamic column rendering based on screen size */}
      {getColumnVisibility('name') && (
        <th role="columnheader" aria-sort={getSortAttribute('name')}>
          {renderHeaderButton('name', 'Tournament Name')}
        </th>
      )}
      {/* Additional columns with conditional visibility */}
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
    {sortedTournaments.map((tournament) => (
      <TournamentRow key={tournament.code} tournament={tournament} />
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

**Responsive Column System (lines 328-352):**
- Priority-based column visibility: name(1), country(2), startDate(3), gender(4), endDate(5), type(6)
- Mobile: Shows only priority 1-3 columns (essential information)
- Tablet: Shows priority 1-4 columns (adds gender)
- Desktop: Shows all columns

**Advanced Scroll Handling (lines 461-472):**
- Horizontal scroll with gradient shadow indicators
- Touch gesture support with `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`
- Scroll position tracking for left/right shadow indicators
- Smooth scrolling with custom scrollbar styling

### shadcn Table Component Integration
[Source: components/ui/table.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Available shadcn Components:**
- `Table` - Wrapper with built-in `overflow-auto` and responsive handling
- `TableHeader` - Semantic `<thead>` with border styling
- `TableBody` - Semantic `<tbody>` with proper row spacing
- `TableHead` - Header cells with consistent padding and typography
- `TableCell` - Data cells with proper alignment and spacing
- `TableRow` - Rows with hover states and transition effects

**shadcn Design Patterns:**
```typescript
// shadcn Table provides built-in responsive handling
<Table className="w-full caption-bottom text-sm">
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead className="h-12 px-4 text-left align-middle font-medium text-muted-foreground">
        Column Header
      </TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow className="border-b transition-colors hover:bg-muted/50">
      <TableCell className="p-4 align-middle">Cell Content</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
```

### Integration Requirements and Migration Strategy

**Critical Preservation Requirements:**
1. **State Management** - All existing state hooks must remain unchanged: `loading`, `error`, `sortConfig`, `screenSize`, `scrollIndicators`
2. **Sorting Logic** - Complete sorting system with `handleSort`, `renderSortIcon`, `getSortAttribute` functions must be preserved
3. **Responsive Behavior** - Existing responsive column visibility logic must be maintained with shadcn components
4. **Accessibility** - All ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation must be preserved
5. **Performance** - Touch scrolling, horizontal scroll handling, and large dataset performance must be maintained

**Migration Approach:**
1. Replace HTML table elements with shadcn components while preserving all className props
2. Integrate shadcn styling with existing responsive logic and custom styling
3. Maintain all event handlers and accessibility attributes
4. Preserve scroll handling and touch gesture support
5. Test thoroughly to ensure no regression in functionality

### Typography and Spacing Enhancement Details
[Source: app/globals.css FIVB theme - Verified 2025-07-30]

**FIVB Theme Integration:**
- Primary color: `hsl(214 100% 40%)` - FIVB Blue (#0066CC)
- Accent color: `hsl(19 91% 60%)` - Beach Orange (#FF6B35)  
- Muted colors: `hsl(210 40% 96%)` for backgrounds, `hsl(215.4 16.3% 46.9%)` for secondary text
- Border colors: `hsl(214.3 31.8% 91.4%)` for consistent table borders

**Typography Enhancements:**
- Header text: Use `text-muted-foreground` for secondary information
- Primary content: Default `foreground` color for high contrast
- Interactive elements: `primary` color for sort indicators and interactive states
- Spacing: shadcn default padding (h-12 for headers, p-4 for cells) for touch-friendly interaction

### Mobile Responsive Optimization
[Source: TournamentTable.tsx mobile card layout (lines 550-573) - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Current Mobile Strategy:**
- Completely different layout for mobile: card-based instead of table
- Mobile cards rendered when `screenSize === 'mobile'`
- Card layout with tournament information in vertical stack format

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Maintain existing mobile card layout as primary mobile experience
- Enhance tablet/desktop table rendering with shadcn Table components
- Improve horizontal scroll experience for edge cases where mobile users prefer table view
- Ensure shadcn Table's responsive utilities work with existing breakpoint detection
