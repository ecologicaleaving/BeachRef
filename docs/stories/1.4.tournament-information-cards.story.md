### Current Mobile Card Implementation Analysis
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentRow.tsx (lines 168-224) - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Current Mobile Card Structure:**
```typescript
// Current mobile card implementation (lines 168-224)
return (
  <div 
    className={`p-5 hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150 active:bg-gray-100 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-inset focus:outline-none ${className}`}
    style={style}
    role="row"
    aria-label={`Tournament: ${tournament.name}, ${countryName}, ${formattedStartDate} to ${formattedEndDate}, ${tournament.gender}, ${tournament.type}`}
    tabIndex={0}
    onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
  >
    {/* Header with name and gender badge */}
    <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-3 min-h-[44px]">
      <div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
        <h4 className="text-base font-medium text-gray-900 leading-snug" title={tournament.name}>
          {tournament.name}
        </h4>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1">{tournament.code}</p>
      </div>
      <span className={`${getGenderBadgeClasses(tournament.gender)} flex-shrink-0`}>
        {tournament.gender}
      </span>
    </div>
    
    {/* Country with flag, Dates, Tournament type sections... */}
  </div>
);
```

**Touch-Friendly Design Features:**
- 44px minimum touch targets consistently applied (`min-h-[44px]`)
- Generous padding (p-5) for comfortable touch interaction
- Proper focus states with ring indicators for accessibility
- Touch-optimized hover states (hover:bg-gray-50, active:bg-gray-100)

### shadcn Card Component Integration
[Source: components/ui/card.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Available shadcn Card Components:**
- `Card` - Main wrapper with shadow, border, and rounded corners (`rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm`)
- `CardHeader` - Header section with consistent spacing (`flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6`)
- `CardTitle` - Title with proper typography (`text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight`)
- `CardDescription` - Subtitle/description with muted styling (`text-sm text-muted-foreground`)
- `CardContent` - Main content area (`p-6 pt-0`)
- `CardFooter` - Footer section with flex layout (`flex items-center p-6 pt-0`)

**shadcn Card Integration Strategy:**
```typescript
// Enhanced shadcn Card implementation
<Card className="hover:bg-muted/50 transition-colors duration-150 cursor-pointer">
  <CardHeader className="pb-3">
    <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-3">
      <div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
        <CardTitle className="text-base font-medium leading-snug">
          {tournament.name}
        </CardTitle>
        <CardDescription className="mt-1">
          {tournament.code}
        </CardDescription>
      </div>
      <Badge variant="secondary" className="flex-shrink-0">
        {tournament.gender}
      </Badge>
    </div>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {/* Country, dates, and tournament information */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### shadcn Badge Component Integration
[Source: components/ui/badge.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Available Badge Variants:**
- `default` - Primary FIVB blue background (`bg-primary text-primary-foreground`)
- `secondary` - Muted background (`bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground`)
- `destructive` - Error/warning state (`bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground`)
- `outline` - Border-only style (`text-foreground`)

**Current Gender Badge Implementation (to replace):**
```typescript
// Current custom badge implementation (lines 82-94)
const getGenderBadgeClasses = (gender: string) => {
  const baseClasses = 'inline-flex items-center px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-full text-xs font-medium';
  switch (gender) {
    case 'Men': return `${baseClasses} bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`;
    case 'Women': return `${baseClasses} bg-pink-100 text-pink-800`;
    case 'Mixed': return `${baseClasses} bg-purple-100 text-purple-800`;
    default: return `${baseClasses} bg-gray-100 text-gray-800`;
  }
};
```

**Enhanced shadcn Badge Implementation:**
```typescript
// Enhanced Badge implementation with FIVB theme
const getTournamentBadgeVariant = (type: string) => {
  switch (type) {
    case 'Men': return 'default'; // FIVB blue
    case 'Women': return 'secondary'; // Muted
    case 'Mixed': return 'outline'; // Outlined
    default: return 'secondary';
  }
};

<Badge variant={getTournamentBadgeVariant(tournament.gender)}>
  {tournament.gender}
</Badge>
```

### View Toggle Implementation Strategy
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx responsive logic (lines 531-635) - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Current Responsive Logic:**
- Mobile (`screenSize === 'mobile'`): Automatically shows card layout
- Tablet/Desktop (`screenSize === 'tablet' || screenSize === 'desktop'`): Shows table layout

**Enhanced View Toggle Requirements:**
1. **User Preference State**: Add `viewPreference` state (table/card/auto)
2. **Toggle Controls**: Header buttons for Table/Card view selection
3. **Responsive Override**: Allow desktop/tablet users to choose card view
4. **Mobile Fallback**: Mobile devices still default to card view for optimal UX

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
const [viewPreference, setViewPreference] = useState<'table' | 'card' | 'auto'>('auto');

const getEffectiveView = useCallback(() => {
  if (viewPreference === 'auto') {
    return screenSize === 'mobile' ? 'card' : 'table';
  }
  return viewPreference;
}, [viewPreference, screenSize]);

const effectiveView = getEffectiveView();
```

### Touch Interaction and Accessibility Requirements
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentRow.tsx accessibility patterns - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Current Accessibility Implementation:**
- Proper ARIA labels with comprehensive tournament information
