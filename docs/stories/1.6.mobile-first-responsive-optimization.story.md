### Current Mobile/Responsive Implementation Analysis
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Current Responsive Breakpoint System:**
```typescript
// Responsive breakpoint detection (lines 42-63)
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    const width = window.innerWidth;
    if (width >= 1024) {
      setScreenSize('desktop');
    } else if (width >= 768) {
      setScreenSize('tablet');
    } else {
      setScreenSize('mobile');
    }
  };
  
  handleResize();
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

**Touch Interaction Patterns:**
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentTable.tsx (lines 75-99)]
- Touch gesture handlers for horizontal scrolling
- Momentum scrolling with `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`
- Touch-friendly swipe detection and scroll prevention
- Keyboard fallback navigation for accessibility

**Current Touch Target Implementation:**
[Source: components/tournament/TournamentRow.tsx - Verified 2025-07-30]
- Consistent 44px minimum touch targets (`min-h-[44px]`)
- Card components with proper touch-friendly spacing
- Interactive elements with appropriate padding and hit areas
- Focus management with ring indicators for accessibility

### Current Theme System Analysis
[Source: app/globals.css - Verified 2025-07-30]

**Existing Theme Structure:**
```css
:root {
  /* FIVB Blue (#0066CC) as primary */
  --primary: 214 100% 40%;
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
  
  /* Beach Volleyball Orange (#FF6B35) as secondary/accent */
  --accent: 19 91% 60%;
  --accent-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  
  /* Muted colors for backgrounds and secondary text */
  --muted: 210 40% 96%;
  --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
}

.dark {
  /* Dark theme variants already implemented */
  --primary: 214 100% 50%;
  --accent: 19 91% 55%;
  /* ... additional dark theme colors */
}
```

**High Contrast Enhancement Strategy:**
Need to create `.high-contrast` theme variant with:
- Enhanced contrast ratios (minimum 7:1 for outdoor readability)
- Stronger border definitions for component separation
- Increased font weights for better legibility
- Enhanced focus indicators for tournament glove usage

### Mobile Network Optimization Requirements
[Source: Existing VIS API integration patterns from previous stories]

**Current Network Handling:**
- VIS API integration with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Error handling for network timeouts and connectivity issues
- Progressive loading patterns for slower connections

**Offline Enhancement Strategy:**
1. **Service Worker Integration**: Cache tournament data for offline access
2. **Network State Detection**: Browser Network Information API integration
3. **Offline UI States**: Clear indicators when data is cached vs live
4. **Sync Patterns**: Background sync when connectivity is restored

### Touch Target and Glove Usage Optimization
[Source: Current touch implementation from Story 1.4]

**Current 44px Implementation:**
- All interactive elements meet baseline 44px requirements
- Card components with proper spacing and padding
- View toggle buttons with appropriate sizing

**Tournament Glove Enhancement Requirements:**
- **Larger Touch Targets**: Consider 48px+ for critical actions
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Stronger hover/active states for gloved usage
- **Simplified Interactions**: Reduce complex gestures in favor of simple taps
- **Error Prevention**: Larger spacing between interactive elements

### Responsive Component Enhancement Strategy

**shadcn Component Mobile Optimization:**
1. **Alert Components**: Enhanced mobile sizing and positioning
2. **Badge Components**: Improved readability on small screens
3. **Button Components**: Optimized sizing for touch interaction
4. **Card Components**: Enhanced spacing and layout for mobile viewing
5. **Table Components**: Improved horizontal scroll and touch handling

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Enhanced responsive hook for mobile-first patterns
const useResponsiveDesign = () => {
  const [screenSize, setScreenSize] = useState<'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop'>('mobile');
  const [isHighContrast, setIsHighContrast] = useState(false);
  const [isOffline, setIsOffline] = useState(!navigator.onLine);
  
  // Mobile-first breakpoint detection with tournament-specific considerations
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      const width = window.innerWidth;
      // Consider device pixel ratio for high-DPI tournament displays
      const effectiveWidth = width * (window.devicePixelRatio || 1);
      
      if (effectiveWidth >= 1024) {
        setScreenSize('desktop');
      } else if (effectiveWidth >= 768) {
        setScreenSize('tablet');
      } else {
        setScreenSize('mobile');
      }
    };
    
    // Network state monitoring for offline detection
    const handleOnline = () => setIsOffline(false);
    const handleOffline = () => setIsOffline(true);
    
    handleResize();
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return { screenSize, isHighContrast, setIsHighContrast, isOffline };
};
```

### High Contrast Theme Implementation
[Source: Current FIVB theme structure - Verified 2025-07-30]

**High Contrast Color Strategy:**
```css
.high-contrast {
  /* Enhanced primary colors for outdoor visibility */
  --primary: 214 100% 25%; /* Darker FIVB blue for better contrast */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 100%; /* Pure white text */
  
  /* Enhanced accent colors */
  --accent: 19 100% 45%; /* Stronger orange for visibility */
  --accent-foreground: 0 0% 100%;
  
  /* High contrast backgrounds and borders */
  --background: 0 0% 100%; /* Pure white background */
  --foreground: 0 0% 0%; /* Pure black text */
  --border: 0 0% 20%; /* Strong border definition */
  --muted: 0 0% 95%; /* Light gray for secondary areas */
  --muted-foreground: 0 0% 20%; /* Dark gray for secondary text */
}
```

**Component Enhancement for High Contrast:**
- Alert components with stronger border and background differentiation
- Badge components with enhanced text contrast and border definition
- Card components with stronger shadow and border for separation
- Button components with enhanced focus indicators and contrast

### Offline State Management Implementation
[Source: Existing error handling patterns from Story 1.5]

**Offline Detection Strategy:**
```typescript
// Enhanced offline detection with tournament venue considerations
const useOfflineState = () => {
  const [isOffline, setIsOffline] = useState(!navigator.onLine);
  const [connectionQuality, setConnectionQuality] = useState<'slow' | 'fast' | 'offline'>('offline');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Network state monitoring
    const handleOnline = () => {
      setIsOffline(false);
      // Test connection quality for tournament venue networks
      testConnectionQuality().then(setConnectionQuality);
    };
    
    const handleOffline = () => {
      setIsOffline(true);
      setConnectionQuality('offline');
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    
    // Initial connection test
    if (navigator.onLine) {
      testConnectionQuality().then(setConnectionQuality);
    }
    
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return { isOffline, connectionQuality };
};

const testConnectionQuality = async (): Promise<'slow' | 'fast'> => {
  try {
    const start = Date.now();
    await fetch('/api/health', { 
      method: 'HEAD',
      cache: 'no-cache'
    });
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    
    // Tournament venue networks are often slow
    return duration > 2000 ? 'slow' : 'fast';
  } catch {
    return 'slow';
  }
};
```

**Offline UI Components:**
- Enhanced error states showing cached data availability
- Offline indicators in tournament table and card views
- Clear messaging about data freshness and sync status
- Progressive enhancement when connectivity is restored

### Performance Optimization for Mobile Networks
