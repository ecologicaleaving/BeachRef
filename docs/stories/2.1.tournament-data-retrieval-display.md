- Use structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging and monitoring

### Tournament Data Architecture
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Tournament]

**Tournament Entity Definition:**
- id: String - Unique VIS tournament identifier
- name: String - Tournament name and title
- location: String - Venue location and address
- startDate: DateTime - Tournament start date/time
- endDate: DateTime - Tournament end date/time
- competitionLevel: String - Professional level (World Tour, Continental, etc.)
- tournamentType: String - Tournament format (Main Draw, Qualifier, etc.)
- status: String - Current status (Upcoming, Live, Completed)
- teams: List<Team> - Participating teams
- lastUpdated: DateTime - Cache timestamp for sync management

**Database Schema Reference:**
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE tournaments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    start_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    end_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    competition_level TEXT NOT NULL,
    tournament_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    teams JSONB,
    last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Service Layer Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]

**VISIntegrationService Integration:**
- Existing service available for FIVB VIS API communication
- Key Interface: `fetchTournaments(filters): Future<List<Tournament>>`
- Dependencies: Supabase Edge Functions, rate limiting controller, error retry logic
- Technology: Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript), rate limiting middleware

**CacheManager Integration:**
- Existing cache management service available
- Key Interfaces: `getCachedTournaments(filters): List<Tournament>`, `updateCache(data): Future<void>`
- Technology: sqflite for local storage, workmanager for background tasks
- Dependencies: SQLite database, background sync worker, cache metadata tracker

### File Location Specifications
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Required File Locations:**
- Data Models: `lib/data/models/tournament.dart`
- Repository Interface: `lib/domain/repositories/tournament_repository.dart`
- Repository Implementation: `lib/data/repositories/tournament_repository_impl.dart`
- Remote Data Source: `lib/data/datasources/remote/tournament_remote_datasource.dart`
- Local Data Source: `lib/data/datasources/local/tournament_local_datasource.dart`
- BLoC State Management: `lib/presentation/blocs/tournament_bloc.dart`
- UI Page: `lib/presentation/pages/tournament_list_page.dart`
- Reusable Widgets: `lib/presentation/widgets/tournament_card.dart`

### UI Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#UI Component Architecture]

**Required UI Components:**
- **TournamentListView:** Filterable tournament master list (primary component for this story)
- **TournamentCard:** Reusable tournament summary display
- **DataTable:** Generic sortable/filterable table component
- **LoadingSpinner:** Async operation feedback
- **StatusBadge:** Visual status indicators

**BLoC Integration Pattern:**
- **TournamentBloc:** Tournament data and filtering state management
- UI components trigger actions through BLoC events
- BLoCs coordinate with service layer components
- Services return data through BLoC states using Result<T, E> pattern
- UI components rebuild based on state changes

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Dependencies:**
- Flutter 3.16.0+ with Dart 3.2.0+
- flutter_bloc 8.1.0+ for state management
- supabase_flutter 2.0.0+ for API communication
- sqflite 2.3.0+ for local caching
- workmanager 0.5.0+ for background sync tasks

**Critical Constraints:**
- VIS API calls limited to ~30 second intervals - implement cache-first operations
- All API responses must use Result<T, Error> pattern for consistent error handling
- Database operations must use repository pattern - no direct Supabase calls from UI
- Background tasks must respect rate limits through coordinated sync service

### Data Synchronization Strategy
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Cache-First Loading Pattern:**
1. UI requests tournament data from repository
2. Repository returns cached data immediately for instant UI feedback
3. Background sync coordinator schedules VIS API refresh (respecting 30s rate limit)
4. Fresh data updates cache and notifies UI through BLoC state changes
5. UI refreshes with updated information

**Sync Coordination:**
- Use existing DataSyncCoordinator service for background synchronization
- Integrate with existing VIS Integration Service for API communication
- Respect 30-second rate limiting constraint for VIS API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for failed sync attempts

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules to Follow:**
- All API responses must use Result<T, Error> pattern
- Never use print() in production - use existing logger service
- Database operations must use repository pattern
- Sensitive data must never be logged
- All service methods must return Future<Result<T, AuthError>> or similar error type

### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

**FIVB VIS API Integration:**
- Endpoint: `GET /tournaments` - Tournament listings with filters
- Rate Limits: ~30 seconds between calls (critical constraint)
- Integration: All VIS calls routed through Supabase Edge Functions
- Authentication: API key or OAuth (handled by existing VIS integration service)

### Project Structure Alignment
All file locations and component architecture align with established Clean Architecture patterns from previous stories. No conflicts identified between story requirements and existing project structure.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Test File Organization:**
- Test files location: `test/` directory mirrors `lib/` structure
- Test file naming: `*_test.dart` suffix for all test files
- Unit tests: `test/unit/` directory structure
- Widget tests: `test/widget/` directory structure  
- Integration tests: `integration_test/` directory structure

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
- Use flutter_test for unit and widget testing
- Use mockito for mocking external dependencies and services
- Use bloc_test for BLoC state management testing
- Use integration_test for end-to-end testing scenarios

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Mock VIS API responses to test different data scenarios
- Test repository pattern with both success and error cases
- Test BLoC state transitions for loading, success, and error states
- Test UI component rendering with different data states (empty, loading, error, success)
- Test responsive design behavior on different screen sizes
- Test pagination and sorting functionality
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all tournament-related components
- Test cache-first loading strategy and offline capabilities
- Test background sync coordination and rate limiting compliance
