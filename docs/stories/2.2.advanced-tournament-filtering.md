## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion:
- Tournament BLoC architecture successfully established with proper state management
- Repository pattern operational with cache-first data loading strategy
- VIS integration service respects 30-second rate limiting constraint
- Tournament data model includes comprehensive fields: id, name, location, startDate, endDate, competitionLevel, tournamentType, status, teams, lastUpdated
- Result<T, E> pattern implemented consistently across all service layers
- Responsive UI design working for both desktop (table) and mobile (card) layouts

Key Learnings:
- Use existing debouncing patterns to prevent excessive API calls during real-time filtering
- Follow established BLoC event/state patterns for consistency with Story 2.1 implementation
- Leverage existing cache infrastructure for filter state persistence
- Maintain performance optimization focus especially for large tournament datasets

### Tournament Data Architecture
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Tournament]

**Tournament Entity Fields Available for Filtering:**
- location: String - Venue location and address (primary filter field)
- startDate: DateTime - Tournament start date/time (date range filtering)
- endDate: DateTime - Tournament end date/time (date range filtering)
- competitionLevel: String - Professional level (World Tour, Continental, etc.)
- tournamentType: String - Tournament format (Main Draw, Qualifier, etc.)
- status: String - Current status (Upcoming, Live, Completed)

**Filter Requirements Based on Data Model:**
- Date Range: Use startDate and endDate for comprehensive date filtering
- Location: Full-text search on location field with autocomplete support
- Tournament Type: Multi-select filtering on tournamentType and competitionLevel fields
- Status: Optional status-based filtering for active tournaments

### BLoC Architecture Extension
[Source: architecture/components.md#UI Component Architecture]

**Existing TournamentBloc Integration:**
- Current events: Load, Refresh, Sort, Paginate (from Story 2.1)
- Current states: Loading, Loaded, Error, Empty (from Story 2.1)
- Required additions: FilterEvents (DateRange, Location, Type, Clear) and FilterState

**Filter State Management Pattern:**
- Extend existing TournamentState to include FilterConfiguration object
- Maintain filter state alongside pagination and sorting state
- Use stream-based updates for real-time filtering without breaking existing functionality
- Implement filter debouncing to respect VIS API rate limiting (30-second constraint)

### UI Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#UI Component Architecture]

**Required New UI Components:**
- **TournamentFilterPanel:** Advanced filtering controls (new component for this story)
- **DateRangePicker:** Date range selection widget
- **LocationAutocomplete:** Location search with suggestions
- **MultiSelectChip:** Tournament type selection
- **FilterBadge:** Active filter indicators
- **FilterSummary:** Display of applied filters

**Integration with Existing Components:**
- Extend existing **TournamentListView** to include filter panel
- Enhance **TournamentCard** to highlight filtered criteria
- Update existing **DataTable** to show filter result counts
- Maintain existing **LoadingSpinner** and error state patterns

### File Location Specifications
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Required File Locations:**
- Filter Panel Widget: `lib/presentation/widgets/tournament_filter_panel.dart`
- Extended BLoC Events: `lib/presentation/blocs/tournament_event.dart` (modify existing)
- Extended BLoC State: `lib/presentation/blocs/tournament_state.dart` (modify existing)
- Extended Repository Interface: `lib/domain/repositories/tournament_repository.dart` (modify existing)
- Extended Repository Implementation: `lib/data/repositories/tournament_repository_impl.dart` (modify existing)
- Filter State Storage: Integration with existing Hive preferences system

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Dependencies (Already Available):**
- flutter_bloc 8.1.0+ for extended state management
- hive 2.2.3+ for filter preference storage
- sqflite 2.3.0+ for optimized local filtering queries
- supabase_flutter 2.0.0+ for filtered API communication

**Performance Constraints:**
- VIS API calls limited to ~30 second intervals - implement filter debouncing
- Use cache-first filtering operations to minimize API dependency
- Optimize local SQLite queries for complex filter combinations
- Implement filter result caching to improve subsequent filter applications

### Data Filtering Strategy
[Source: architecture/components.md#CacheManager]

**Cache-First Filtering Pattern:**
1. Apply filters to cached tournament data for immediate UI feedback
2. Schedule background sync with filter parameters (respecting 30s rate limit)
3. Update cache with filtered results from VIS API
4. Refresh UI with updated filtered data
5. Maintain filter state persistence through navigation and app lifecycle

**Filter Optimization:**
- Use existing CacheManager interfaces for filter state storage
- Leverage SQLite WHERE clauses for efficient local filtering
- Implement filter combination caching for frequently used filter sets
- Use existing DataSyncCoordinator for background filtered data refresh

### Filter State Persistence
[Source: architecture/components.md#CacheManager]

**User Preference Integration:**
- Store filter preferences using existing Hive key-value store
- Key structure: `user_filter_preferences_{userId}` for personalized defaults
- Include date range preferences, preferred locations, and tournament type selections
- Restore filter state on app startup and navigation between pages

**Session State Management:**
- Maintain filter state in BLoC during app session
- Persist active filters when navigating away from tournament list
- Restore filter state when returning to tournament list page
- Clear transient filters on app restart while preserving user preferences

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules to Follow:**
- All filter operations must use Result<T, Error> pattern from existing implementation
- Never use print() for debugging - use existing logger service with correlation IDs
- Filter state persistence must handle failures gracefully with fallback to defaults
- Network filtering operations must degrade gracefully to cached data when VIS API unavailable
- All filter methods must return Future<Result<List<Tournament>, FilterError>> pattern

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Test File Organization:**
- Test files location: `test/` directory mirrors `lib/` structure
- Test file naming: `*_test.dart` suffix for all test files
- Unit tests: `test/unit/` directory structure
- Widget tests: `test/widget/` directory structure  
- Integration tests: `integration_test/` directory structure

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Mock filter operations with various data scenarios (empty results, large datasets)
- Test filter state persistence and restoration across app lifecycle
- Test filter combination scenarios and edge cases
- Test performance optimization with simulated large tournament datasets
- Test filter debouncing and rate limiting compliance
- Test responsive filter panel design on different screen sizes
- Test accessibility features for filter controls
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all filtering-related components

### Project Structure Alignment
All file locations and component architecture align with established Clean Architecture patterns from Story 2.1. Filter functionality extends existing patterns without breaking established structure. No conflicts identified between filtering requirements and existing project structure.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**

**Filter-Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test all filter combination scenarios (date + location + type)
- Test filter performance with large mock datasets (1000+ tournaments)
- Test filter state persistence across navigation and app restart
- Test filter debouncing to ensure API rate limiting compliance
- Test filter UI responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
