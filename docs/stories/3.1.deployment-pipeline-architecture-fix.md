## Dev Notes

### Previous Context
- **Critical Issue**: Current deployment failure rate of ~95% due to pipeline conflicts
- **Epic 3**: Production deployment focus requires reliable deployment infrastructure
- **Blocking**: Story 3.1 (Production Error Handling) depends on successful deployment capability

This story addresses the fundamental deployment infrastructure issues that are preventing the team from reliably deploying to production.

### Architecture Context
[Source: GitHub Actions workflow analysis & Vercel configuration review]

**Current Problem Analysis:**
- **Dual Pipeline Conflict**: Both GitHub Actions and Vercel attempting to build/deploy
- **Node Version Mismatch**: GitHub Actions using 18.x, Vercel using different version
- **Package Installation Mismatch**: npm ci vs npm install causing lock file conflicts
- **Build Process Redundancy**: Duplicate compilation causing resource waste and timing issues

**Recommended Architecture:**
- **Primary Deployment**: Vercel-only deployment triggered by GitHub push
- **CI/CD Role**: GitHub Actions for testing, linting, type checking only
- **Caching Strategy**: Leveraged Vercel build cache with npm ci consistency
- **Environment Parity**: Identical Node 20.x across all environments

### Implementation Priority
This story MUST be completed before any other Epic 3 stories, as deployment capability is prerequisite for production readiness work.

### Testing Strategy

**Test File Locations:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (updated for testing only)
- `vercel.json` (optimized configuration)
- `package.json` (updated engines and scripts)

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Successful deployment from main branch push
- Pull request CI testing without deployment conflicts
- Build cache effectiveness and speed improvements
- Deployment rollback functionality
- Cross-environment consistency validation

### Production Considerations

**Deployment Monitoring:**
- Vercel deployment webhooks for success/failure tracking
- GitHub Actions status checks for code quality gates
- Performance monitoring for deployment speed optimization

**Reliability Measures:**
- Automated rollback on deployment failure
- Health check endpoints for deployment verification
- Staged deployment with traffic shifting capability

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation** - The deployment pipeline architecture fix demonstrates senior-level system design and implementation. All acceptance criteria have been met with a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of deployment failures. The solution follows infrastructure-as-code principles with proper validation, testing, and documentation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns between CI and deployment
- Comprehensive validation scripts with proper error handling
- Environment consistency across all deployment contexts
- Production-ready configuration with monitoring and rollback capabilities

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `scripts/validate-deployment.js`
