### Required New Components Architecture
[Source: Epic 3 UX specifications]

**Tournament Detail Page Structure:**
```
app/tournament/[code]/
├── page.tsx                 # Main tournament detail page
├── loading.tsx              # Loading skeleton for tournament details
└── error.tsx                # Error handling for tournament not found
```

**Component Architecture:**
```
TournamentDetailPage
├── TournamentBreadcrumb     # shadcn Breadcrumb navigation
├── TournamentHeader         # shadcn Card + Badge layout
├── TournamentDetailTabs     # shadcn Tabs organization
│   ├── OverviewTab         # Tournament basic information
│   ├── ScheduleTab         # Tournament schedule (future Epic 3.2)
│   ├── ResultsTab          # Tournament results (future Epic 3.2)
│   └── TeamsTab            # Participant information (future Epic 3.2)
└── TournamentMobileActions  # shadcn Sheet for mobile quick actions
```

### VIS API Extension Strategy
[Source: Existing lib/vis-client.ts patterns]

**New API Integration:**
```typescript
// Extend existing Tournament interface
interface TournamentDetail extends Tournament {
  venue?: string;
  description?: string;
  status?: 'upcoming' | 'live' | 'completed';
  // Additional fields for Epic 3.2
}

// New API function following existing patterns
export async function fetchTournamentDetails(code: string): Promise<TournamentDetail> {
  // Use existing retry logic and error handling patterns
  // Follow existing XML request/response parsing
}
```

**API Route Structure:**
```typescript
// app/api/tournament/[code]/route.ts
// Use identical caching patterns as existing /api/tournaments
// 5-minute cache TTL with tournament code as cache key
```

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
[Source: Existing project structure]

**New Files to Create:**
- `app/tournament/[code]/page.tsx` - Dynamic route page component
- `app/tournament/[code]/loading.tsx` - Tournament detail loading state
- `app/tournament/[code]/error.tsx` - Tournament detail error boundary
- `app/api/tournament/[code]/route.ts` - Tournament detail API endpoint
- `components/tournament/TournamentDetailPage.tsx` - Main detail page component
- `components/tournament/TournamentBreadcrumb.tsx` - Breadcrumb navigation
- `components/tournament/TournamentHeader.tsx` - Tournament header with Card + Badge
- `components/tournament/TournamentDetailTabs.tsx` - Tabbed content organization
- `lib/tournament-detail-api.ts` - Tournament detail API client functions

**Files to Modify:**
- `lib/vis-client.ts` - Add fetchTournamentDetails function
- `lib/types.ts` - Extend Tournament interface with TournamentDetail
- `components/tournament/TournamentRow.tsx` - Add Link navigation to detail page

### Responsive Design Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 mobile-first patterns and Epic 3 UX specifications]

**Mobile-First Implementation:**
- 48px minimum touch targets for tournament venue glove usage
- Progressive disclosure with Sheet component for mobile actions
- Breadcrumb navigation optimized for mobile screens
- Tabbed organization with touch-friendly interaction
- Existing responsive breakpoints: mobile (default), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)

**Component Responsive Patterns:**
```typescript
// Use existing responsive design patterns
import { useResponsiveDesign } from '@/hooks/useResponsiveDesign';

const { screenSize } = useResponsiveDesign();
// Apply mobile-specific behaviors when screenSize === 'mobile'
```

### Error Handling Integration
[Source: Existing error handling patterns from Epic 1]

**Tournament Not Found Handling:**
- Use existing VISApiError class for consistent error handling
- Implement proper 404 handling for invalid tournament codes
- Follow existing error boundary patterns with user-friendly messages
- Maintain existing retry mechanisms for VIS API failures

### Caching Strategy
[Source: Existing server-side caching from Epic 2]

**Tournament Detail Caching:**
- Follow identical patterns as `/api/tournaments` route
- 5-minute cache TTL with tournament code as cache key
- Use existing cache validation and cleanup patterns
- Prevent excessive VIS API calls for tournament detail requests
