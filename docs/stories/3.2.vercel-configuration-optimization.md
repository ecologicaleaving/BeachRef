## Dev Notes

### Previous Context
- **Story 3.1**: Deployment Pipeline Architecture Fix must be completed first
- **Epic 3**: Production deployment optimization focus
- **Dependencies**: Requires successful deployment pipeline from Story 3.1

This story builds on the foundational deployment infrastructure to optimize the Vercel platform specifically for production performance and reliability.

### Architecture Context
[Source: Vercel documentation & Next.js 14 optimization best practices]

**Current Vercel Configuration:**
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

**Optimized Configuration Requirements:**
- **Build Command**: Optimized for production with proper caching
- **Install Command**: Changed to npm ci for consistency
- **Environment Variables**: Proper staging and production separation
- **Headers**: Security and performance optimization
- **Functions**: Optimized serverless function configuration

**Performance Targets:**
- Build Time: <2 minutes (down from current ~5+ minutes)
- Deploy Time: <3 minutes total from push to live
- First Contentful Paint: <2s on 3G
- Time to Interactive: <3s on 3G

### Implementation Priority
This story depends on Story 3.1 completion and should be implemented immediately after successful deployment pipeline establishment.

### Testing Strategy

**Test File Locations:**
- `vercel.json` (optimized configuration)
- `next.config.js` (production optimizations)
- `__tests__/deployment/vercel-config.test.ts`

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Successful build with optimized configuration
- Environment variable injection and access
- Security header validation
- Performance monitoring data collection
- Health check endpoint functionality
- Automated rollback trigger testing

### Production Considerations

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Build time and success rate tracking
- Application performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- User experience impact analysis

**Security Measures:**
- Proper environment variable encryption
- Security header enforcement
- SSL certificate management
- Access control for sensitive endpoints
