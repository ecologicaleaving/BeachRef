# 13. Implementation Notes

## Technology Stack Integration
- **Framework**: React + Vite with shadcn/ui components
- **Component Mapping**:
  - Data Tables → Data Table + TanStack Table integration
  - Forms → Input + Select + Date Picker + Command
  - Navigation → Breadcrumb + Button components
  - Feedback → Alert + Skeleton + Badge + Toast
  - Layout → Card + Separator + Dialog
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS following shadcn/ui patterns
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query (TanStack Query) for API state management
- **API Integration**: RESTful calls to VIS database

## shadcn/ui Setup Requirements
- **Installation**: Follow shadcn/ui installation guide for Vite
- **Configuration**: Customize theme colors for FIVB Blue (#0066CC)
- **Components**: Install required components based on page stacks defined in component specifications
- **Extensions**: Consider community extensions for Date Range Picker functionality

## Component Implementation Guidelines
- **Data Table**: Use TanStack Table integration for advanced sorting and filtering
- **Loading States**: Implement Skeleton components matching actual content layout
- **Error Boundaries**: Wrap components with proper error handling using Alert components
- **Responsive Design**: Leverage shadcn/ui's mobile-first responsive patterns

## Development Priorities
1. Core data display (tournament list, details)
2. Search and filtering functionality
3. Responsive design implementation
4. Error handling and loading states
5. Accessibility features and testing

## Testing Strategy
- Component unit tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing on various devices and connections
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
